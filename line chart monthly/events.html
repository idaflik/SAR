  <ul>
    <li>October 2016:  <a href="https://frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/focus/joint-operation-triton-italy--ekKaes">Operation Triton</a> replaces <a href="http://www.marina.difesa.it/EN/operations/Pagine/MareNostrum.aspx">Mare Nostrum</a> (a one year Italian  humanitarian rescue program). Operation Triton is an EU border control operation which did not include Sea and Rescue operations (SAR), this gap was filled by NGOs.
    </li>
    <li>November 2014: <a href="https://www.operationsophia.eu/about-us/">Operation Sophia</a>, an EU military operation on migration, begins training Libyan coastguards and navy. This means that more migrants will be stopped by the Libyan authorities as well as handed over to them and taken to Libya, preventing people from reaching the EU.  </li>
    <li>December 2016: <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/LY/DetainedAndDehumanised_en.pdf">UN report</a> documents widespread malnutrition, forced labor, illness, beatings, sexual abuse, torture, and other abuses in immigration detention centres in Libya.
    </li>
    <li>May 2017: Italian coast guards <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/19/eu-shifting-rescue-libya-risks-lives">start</a> transferring responsibility for rescues in international waters to Libyan coast guard forces even when there are other, better-equipped vessels, including its own patrol boats or Italian navy vessels, closer to the scene. This practice becomes <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/07/25/eu/italy/libya-disputes-over-rescues-put-lives-risk">routine</a></li>
    <li>May 2017: Libyan coast guard speedboat impedes rescue attempts of four NGOs by <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-05-24/libya-s-coast-guard-further-endangering-migrants-crossing-mediterranean">firing gunshots</a>. This is one of <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/07/25/eu/italy/libya-disputes-over-rescues-put-lives-risk">many</a> incidents with the Libyan coast guard reported by NGO rescue missions.
    </li>
    <li>July/August 2017: Italy pressures NGOs to sign a <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2017/08/03/text-of-italys-code-of-conduct-for-ngos-involved-in-migrant-rescue">code of conduct</a>. The code <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rosebuchanan/this-is-why-ngos-say-its-getting-harder-to-save-peoples">prohibits</a> the standard practice of transferring rescued people to bigger ships and requires vessels to immediately return to an Italian port after rescuing one group. This extends the time needed for a single rescue operation from a few hours to multiple days and effectively make operations for small rescue boats without their own transporting capacities impossible. It also required NGOs to accept police officers on board.</li>
    <li>August 2017: MSF, Save the Children and Sea Eye <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/14/three-ngos-halt-mediterranean-migrant-rescues-after-libyan-hostility">suspend</a> their SAR operations due to repeated intimidations and threats from Libyan coast guard vessels.</li>
    <li>August 2017: The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JugendRettet/posts/709774179231818">Iuventa</a> is the first boat to be <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/04/20/mediterranean-refugee-rescue-boat-italy-libya/">seized</a>.</li>
    <li>June 2018: Far-right politician Salvini takes over as Italy’s interior minister and barres the Aquarius, the Lifeline and Seefuchs <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/06/italy-closes-ports-mediterranean-rescue-ships-180617123035268.html">from entering</a> the country’s ports. This marks the beginning of Italy’s anti-immigration and closed-ports policy.</li>
    <li>June 2018: The President of the European Council <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/06/29/remarks-by-president-donald-tusk-on-the-european-council-meeting-of-28-june-2018/pdf/">sends</a> “a clear message to all vessels, including those of NGOs, operating in the Mediterranean, that they must respect the law and must not obstruct the operation of the Libyan Coast Guard”.</li>
    <li>July 2018: International Maritime Organization recognizes a <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2018/07/06/prompted-by-eu-libya-quietly-claims-right-to-order-rescuers-to-return-fleeing-migrants">newly declared Libyan SAR zone</a>, which hands over responsibility over Search and Rescue activities to Libyan authorities for a large area of international waters. Concerns over migrants’ and NGO crews’ safety increase.</li>

    <li>December 2018: <a href="https://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2019/2019-update-ngos-sar-activities">Aquarius stops</a> <a href="https://www.msf.org/aquarius-forced-end-operations-europe-condemns-people-drown">operations</a> after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/07/dark-day-migrant-rescue-ship-aquarius-ends-operations-mediterranean">Panama</a> - pressured by Italy - revoked its flag and 24 staff members were put under<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/20/italy-orders-seizure-aquarius-migrant-rescue-ship-hiv-clothes"> investigation</a> by Italian authorities for &ldquo;illegal management of waste&rdquo;.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>January 2019: Two ships are <a href="https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/fra-2019-ngos-search-rescue-mediterranean-table-2_en.pdf">blocked</a> by the Spanish government by being denied permission to sail to the Central Mediterranean. In April, they are allowed to head to the waters between Greece and Turkey to deliver humanitarian aid goods, but still <a href="https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/16715/hoping-to-help-the-long-journey-of-a-spanish-rescue-ship-banned-from-rescues">not allowed</a> to rescue people or approach the Central Mediterranean.</li>

    <li>August 2019: Italy&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/09/05/italys-new-government-should-undo-its-worst-migration-policies-0">&ldquo;closed ports&rdquo; policy</a> is formalized. Rescue ships are barred from entering Italian territorial waters. Violation of the decree means fines of up to <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/08/1043751">&euro;1 million </a>and seizure of the ship. Resistance to Italian security forces' attempts to block rescue ships from entering a safe harbour could be <a href="https://mission-lifeline.de/missionen/">punished with up to ten years in prison</a>.</li>
    <li>June 2019: Seizures and blockades of NGO rescue vessels becoming increasingly <a href="https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/fra-2019-migration-bulletin-3_en.pdf">frequent</a>, partly based on new Italian legislation.</li>
    <li>September 2019: Luciana Lamorgese <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/matteo-salvini-replaced-by-migration-specialist-in-new-italy-coalition">replaces</a> Salvini as Italian Minister of Interior. She gave some <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/salvini-italy-migration-policy-190910121122318.html">hope</a> to SAR NGOs but has not overturned Italy&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/hundreds-refugees-italy-face-losing-shelter-2019-191224074821410.html">anti-immigrant </a>policies <a href="http://www.ansa.it/english/news/politics/2020/01/13/changing-security-decrees-ok-says-conte_a1ad5a20-93bd-4273-b6c9-d1082eb0ffca.html">yet</a>.
