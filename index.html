    <h1>Central Mediterranean deadlier than ever while states hamper rescue efforts</h1>

    <p>The death-rate on the treacherous Central Mediterranean crossing has increased for the second consecutive year in 2019, while European authorities and Libyan forces have continued to hamper NGO Search and Rescue (SAR) efforts.
    </p>

    <p>Figures show that in 2018 and 2019, despite fewer total crossings than in the 2015-16 period, approximately one in twenty of those attempting to make the crossing on this route lost their lives.

    Meanwhile, continued <a target="_blank" href="https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/migrant-rescue-ship-alan-kurdi-threatened-by-libya-coastguards.744984">violent threats and interference</a> of Libyan coast guards and sanctions from EU-state authorities have left NGOs assisting with rescue operations in an increasingly precarious position.
    </p>

    <p>Back in 2018, when the death rate almost doubled from the previous year, “many aid workers attributed the increase in deaths at sea to efforts by various authorities to prevent rescues,” according to <a target="_blank" href="https://theintercept.com/2018/09/16/migrant-rescue-mediterranean-sea/ ">the Intercept.</a>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 3em;">In 2019, the number of rescue ships that were seized or blocked by authorities was higher or equal to the number of vessels that were active during the same period for any given month.

    <p>The German NGO Mission Lifeline began rescue operations in 2016 and is currently in the process of buying a third ship, after its first two were seized by Italian authorities in June 2018 and September 2019 respectively.
    </p>

    <p>The organisation’s spokesperson Axel Steier told MIJ that state-sanctioned seizure of SAR ships is increasingly common.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom:3em">“In fact, it is easy for the states to confiscate the ships on the basis of whatever legal basis.
There is actually not much stopping them and even if there were no legal basis, the ships
would still be confiscated.”

      <p>Saving lives in the Mediterranean was not always so fraught.
      </p>

      <p>After over 360 migrants <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24866338">drowned</a> off the coast of Italian island Lampedusa in October 2013, Italian authorities launched a year-long <a target="_blank" href="http://www.marina.difesa.it/EN/operations/Pagine/MareNostrum.aspx">operation</a> with funding from the European commission, focusing on “safeguarding human life at sea” and “bringing to justice human traffickers and migrant smugglers.”
      </p>

      <p>Operation Mare Nostrum, as it was known, was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iom.int/news/iom-applauds-italys-life-saving-mare-nostrum-operation-not-migrant-pull-factor">praised</a> by the International Organisation for Migration for its success in rescuing 150,000 migrants in the Mediterranean, and, according to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/04/20/italy-ran-an-operation-that-save-thousands-of-migrants-from-drowning-in-the-mediterranean-why-did-it-stop/">reporting</a> from the Washington Post, it additionally provided medical treatment, shelter, food and legal aid to migrants.
      </p>

      <p>When other EU States declined to assist in its continued funding, the operation was replaced by a greatly scaled-back programme, Operation Triton, run by border patrol agency Frontex, focussing on border control and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/15/eu-states-migrant-rescue-operations-mediterranean ">ending</a> proactive SAR efforts within the <a target="_blank" href="https://theintercept.com/2017/04/01/europe-keeps-its-rescue-ships-far-from-the-coast-of-libya-where-thousands-of-refugees-have-drowned/ ">deadliest</a> zone off the Libyan coast.
      </p>

      <p>It was in this context of lacking state-administered SAR programmes that NGOs began their involvement with ship rescue missions in the Mediterranean, starting in 2015.
      </p>

      <p>At least a dozen organisations have been involved in carrying out SAR missions since then, and have rescued <a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardiacostiera.gov.it/attivita/Pages/Ricerca.aspx">99526 people</a> between 2016 and 2019.
      </p>

      <p>The first seizure of an NGO rescue ship took place in August 2017, when Italian authorities seized the Iuventa on the island of Lampedusa. The ship’s crew were accused of colluding with smugglers, a claim the ship’s NGO <a target="_blank" href="https://jugendrettet.org/f/files/PM_090718_ENGL_web.pdf ">denies</a>.
      </p>

      <p>This was the first in a <a target="_blank" href="https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/fra-2019-ngos-search-rescue-mediterranean-table-2_en.pdf">litany</a> of state-sanctioned seizures and blockages, mainly by Italian--but also by Spanish and Maltese--authorities, effectively deterring civil sea rescuing efforts in the Central Mediterranean.
      </p>

      <p>Most of the SAR NGOs in the Mediterranean <atarget="_blank" href="https://www.ecre.org/interview-ready-to-rescue-caught-up-in-politics/">focus their operations</a> on the area where international waters begin, 22 kilometers off the Libyan coast.

      </p><p>

      But multiple NGOs thought it necessary to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theafricancourier.de/uncategorized/ngos-stop-refugee-rescue-operations-off-libyan-coast/">suspend</a> their efforts there in 2017.

      </p><p>

      In addition to patrolling and allegedly <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/04/drones-replace-patrol-ships-mediterranean-fears-more-migrant-deaths-eu">forcing boats back</a> to Libya within the 22 km zone of their national waters, Libyan coast guards have extended their presence and activity <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/19/eu-shifting-rescue-libya-risks-lives">into international territories</a>, encouraged by Italy and the EU. Migrants pulled back to Libya are placed in detention centres, where according to a 2016 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/LY/DetainedAndDehumanised_en.pdf">UN report</a>, detainees are subjected to arbitrary detention, torture, unlawful killings and sexual exploitation and other ill-treatment.

      </p><p>

      EU training of the Libyan coast guard was <a target="_blank" href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-towards-a-new-policy-on-migration/file-eunavfor-med-operation-sophia">agreed to</a> already in June 2016, and in May 2017, Italy would begin <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/19/eu-shifting-rescue-libya-risks-lives">transferring</a> its SAR responsibilities to the country—a trend which continued when the official Libyan SAR zone was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/07/25/eu/italy/libya-disputes-over-rescues-put-lives-risk">expanded</a> the following year. </p><p>


      It was not until November 2019 that EU officials <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/20/migrants-detained-in-libya-for-profit-leaked-eu-report-reveals">admitted</a> in a leaked paper that monitoring of Libyan coast guard activities is impossible, that the migrant detention centres are a profitable business model, and that widespread human rights violations, deaths, unexplained disappearances, bribery and corruption still take place within the centres. </p>
      <p>

     During this past year, Italy announced <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/15/italy-adopts-decree-that-could-fine-migrant-rescue-ngo-aid-up-to-50000">laws</a> barring SAR ships from entering Italian ports in June, which it strengthened in August to include <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/08/1043751">fines</a> of up to €1 million and <a target="_blank" href="https://mission-lifeline.de/missionen/">prison sentences</a> for failure to cooperate with the authorities.   </p><p>

     The next month, Italy’s Five Star Movement government lost support and Luciana Lamorgese became Italy’s new Minister of Interior, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/matteo-salvini-replaced-by-migration-specialist-in-new-italy-coalition">replacing</a> Salvini, far-right Minister of Interior and the face of Italy’s anti-immigrant policies. She was received with some <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/salvini-italy-migration-policy-190910121122318.html">hope</a> by SAR NGOs, who believed she would soften the recently implemented policies. </p>
    </div>



    <p>In December 2019, Steier from Mission Lifeline confirmed to MIJ that only two boats remain able to continue with SAR missions off the Libyan coast while the other two active boats are required to remain within the Maltese SAR zone. </p><p>


    A total of five vessels are currently seized by authorities including the Iuventa, one in Malta and the others in Italian ports. Other NGO ships have voluntarily <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/refugee-ship-aquarius-stop-rescue-mission-mediterranean-181207062845983.html">stopped operations</a>, some citing “relentless pressure from EU states” and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.savethechildren.org/us/what-we-do/emergency-response/rescue-at-sea">concerns</a> for the “safety and security of our staff” as reasons.
     </p><p>


    Giorgia Linardi, spokeswoman of NGO Sea Watch, told <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/salvini-italy-migration-policy-190910121122318.html ">Al Jazeera</a> that there is a need for concrete action to reduce the concerns of NGOs, and that September’s change in the Italian government does not necessarily mean a change of substance.
     </p><p>

    “We got used to too many words and few facts," she said. "I don't think we can call the establishment of a new government a victory as long as people keep drowning into the Mediterranean."

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>We retrieved the operational status of all NGO Search and Rescue Vessels working in the Central Mediterranean, for each month from January 2014 until December 2019. Sources include news reports, position data from <a target="_blank" href="www.marinetraffic.com">MarineTraffic</a>, reports from the <a target="_blank" href="https://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2019/2019-update-ngos-sar-activities">European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights</a>, updates from the NGOs' own websites and social media posts. All NGOs mentioned were sent a copy of our data along with a request for verification.
    </p>
    <p>When authorities seized or impounded a vessel, it is marked as "seized" in the dataset for that month; if it was not seized for the entire month, the data entry will say "seized on XX" or "seized until", respectively. When authorities rendered impossible the operation of a vessel by other (legal) means, such as not granting a permission to sail or leave a port, the vessel is marked as "blocked" / "blocked since XX" / "blocked until" in our data set. If vessels paused their operations for reasons such as maintenance, fundraising etc during an entire month, it is marked as "paused".</p>
    <p>When we calculated the number of active vessels for a given month, only those that were operational during the entire month were counted. Those that were seized or blocked - even if only for part of that month - didn't count towards those numbers. Therefore, our data does not represent the maximum amount of vessels that could be found in the Central Mediterranean on the most frequented day in history; our data only represent those vessels for each month that were operational during the entire month.
